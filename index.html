					<h2>What are plugins?</h2>
				</section>

				<section data-background="img/blackboard.jpg">
					<p>According to the WordPress Codex: <q cite="https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins">
						&ldquo;Plugins are ways to extend and add to the functionality that already exists in WordPress.
The core of WordPress is designed to be lean and lightweight, to maximize flexibility and minimize code bloat. Plugins then offer custom functions and features so that each user can tailor their site to their specific needs.&rdquo;</q>
					</p>
				</section>

				<section data-background="img/question.jpg">
					<h2>What plugins should I use?</h2>
				</section>

				<section data-background="img/blackboard.jpg">
					<p>There is no such thing as an essential plugin. It will depend upon your site's needs and other factors such as the hosting platform you are on.</p>
					<p class="fragment">If a plugin were 'essential' to the running of WordPress it would be already have been incorporated into the core of WordPress</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						1. Hosting: If your host does auto backups you don't need a backup plugin. Similarly with caching plugins.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background="img/blackboard.jpg">
					<h2>First things first - planning</h2>
					<p class="fragment">Rather than asking what plugins you should use, ask yourself what functionality you need your site to have.</p>
					<p class="fragment">For anything more than a hobbyist site you should plan out what you want to achieve. Think about what the essential objectives of your site are and plan to meet those.</p>
					<p class="fragment">Beware of adding lots of bells and whistles to your site - you might end up distracting users from what you really want to achieve.</p>

				</section>

				<section data-background="img/blackboard.jpg">
					<h2>Keep it simple</h2>
					<p class="fragment">The idea of planning a site is to boil things down to the essentials and focus on your key objectives.</p>
					<p class="fragment">This will help when selecting plugins, but will also help avoid the site growing out of control. The easier it is for a user to get the information the better. Ideally the user will be able to get the information from the front page without clicking on anything...</p>
					<p class="fragment">...With this in mind think about simple ways to implement your objectives without using plugins. For example do you need a contact form on your site when a simple email address will do the job?</p>

					<h2>Plugins best practice</h2>
					<p>Develop your site locally. Spin up a test site, seperate from your main project and have fun experimenting with plugins there. Test them and make decisions there before installing on your main site.</p>
					<p>Research your plugins. Look at reviews, number of installs etc. But also look at the level of support - check out resources such as <a href="https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/">wpmudev</a></p>
					<p>Backup your database and files before updating plugins - but keep plugins and WordPress core updated</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						1. This is good practice for many reasons. Will stop db being clogged up - get you to feel comfortable - allows free experimentation.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background="img/blackboard.jpg">
					<h2>Plugins and themes</h2>
					<p>Themes do more than control the look of a site. They provide areas for posts and widgets to appear in and can affect the content of posts.</p>
					<p>Therefore be aware that some plugins will not work with some themes, and that some themes have been written with specific plugins in mind - so other plugins may not sit happily with them.</p>
					<p>If you are thinking of using a bespoke theme for your project you need to consider how it will affect plugin functionality. Again this comes down to planning.</p>

					<h2>Plugin pitfalls</h2>

				<section data-background="img/blackboard.jpg">
					<ul>
					<li>Plugins can conflict with each other</li>
					<li class="fragment">Badly written plugins can slow your site down</li>
					<li class="fragment">Lots of plugins can make the admin and new post areas a mess of options</li>
					<li class="fragment">Plugins seldom do exactly what you want - you need to be adaptable</li>
					<li class="fragment">As WordPress is upgraded older plugins can stop working</li>
					</ul>

						1. Explain why plugins should be disabled before using a new one
						3. Explain about clients using site and keeping it simple for them
